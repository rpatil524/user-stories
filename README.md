# User Stories for Solid

This repository is meant for gathering user stories. User Stories are short 
descriptions of a need written from the perspective of a user, see 
[this article for an example](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories). 
They are generally of the form:

> As a **type-of-user**, I want to **some-goal** so that **some-reason**.

To submit such a story, 
[open an issue](https://github.com/solid/user-stories/issues/new), and put the 
user story itself as the title. You may elaborate on it in the text, but strive 
to make the idea succinct enough to fit in that single line.

Before posting a new story, please check if there already exist stories that 
cover your it. It might be beneficial to check 
[the labels](https://github.com/solid/user-stories/labels) we use to categorize
the stories.

Ideas that aren't fitting very well in this short format or need discussing 
first can be submitted
[to the forum](https://forum.solidproject.org/c/1-about-solid/app-communities).

The idea is that developers and architects can use these stories in their 
development efforts.

Obviously, Solid presents a wide open space of opportunity, and so, some 
things are relevant to different parts of the system. Most will be uses of 
Solid, as it is defined by [the specs](https://github.com/solid/specification),
for example, the story

> As a pretty distracted person, I want to record my tasks in a TODO
> list so that I won't forget them.

Other things may require new functionality from the server, for example:

> As a father, I want to set up a server for my family and only them,
> retaining some control of my children's accounts, to keep them safe
> on the Web.

This would require something new from the registration system, in
terms of limits on who can register and what default Access Control
Lists they will be given.

Other stories might be more about social or legal aspects, such as

> As a Solid user I want to be able to use Solid independently of any single 
> legal entity that I do not have influence over so that I can be in control

All stories are welcome in this repository.
